# 100 Days Of Code - Log

For the first project, I'm going to be working on a small guard-clauses library written with C#. The goal is to reach productivity on dotnet core, as well as learn how to create and publish a Nuget package,

### Day 1: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created the repository locally, adding the production and test projects using `dotnet new`. Created a "gh-pages" branch, so I can create a GitHub Pages site when the time comes. Created a repo on GitHub, added it as a remote and pushed the code to it.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with making unit tests work under dotnet core. I keep getting weird compiling errors and restore failings.

### Day 2: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some tests for the main class and made them all pass. Wrote tests first. I was able to get the tests running using Visual Studio.

**Thoughts:** Need to understand better about how versioning works in .Net Core. Also, I need to see how to set up the build and test running via command line.
