# 100 Days Of Code - Log

For the first project, I'm going to be working on a small guard-clauses library written with C#. The goal is to reach productivity on dotnet core, as well as learn how to create and publish a Nuget package,

### Day 1: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created the repository locally, adding the production and test projects using `dotnet new`. Created a "gh-pages" branch, so I can create a GitHub Pages site when the time comes. Created a repo on GitHub, added it as a remote and pushed the code to it.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with making unit tests work under dotnet core. I keep getting weird compiling errors and restore failings.

### Day 2: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some tests for the main class and made them all pass. Wrote tests first. I was able to get the tests running using Visual Studio.

**Thoughts:** Need to understand better about how versioning works in .Net Core. Also, I need to see how to set up the build and test running via command line.

### Day 3: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Not a super productive day. Struggled a little bit with building the lib on Visual Studio, despite everything working fine via command line. Despite my troubles, I was able to write a couple of tests for a new method and made them pass by implementing said method.

**Thoughts:** TODO - Learn more about .NET Standard, .NET core, the various options for target framework and how those things relate to one another. My knowledge about all of this is close to zero, which is a shame.
